# ANTICS

ARE

- Small disruptions that create new social or creative outcomes

- Actions that aren’t supposed to be valuable but somehow are 

- Non-optimized behaviors; doing things because they’re fun, not because they’re efficient

IS

- A sandbox for harmless collective misbehavior 

- A lightweight engine for structured unpredictability 

- A digitally native way to introduce healthy mischief into an otherwise optimized life
